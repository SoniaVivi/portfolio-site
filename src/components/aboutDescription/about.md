Aspiring web developer with an intense love of coding, tea (especially
sencha!), and dogs.

I first began coding ten years ago, mainly utilizing C++ up until 2019. At which point I then began learning web development and branched out to other languages such as Ruby, Javascript, Python, and more.

Initially I intended to take a gap year before entering university, however with the advent of the pandemic I decided to go the self-teaching route.

Favorite Programming Language: Ruby

Favorite Tea: Yutaka Midori shincha from O-cha.com

Favorite Manga: Mieruko-chan (見える子ちゃん) by Izumi Tomoki
