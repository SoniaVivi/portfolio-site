Aspiring web developer with an intense love of coding, tea (especially
sencha!), and dogs. Mainly focused on front-end development, but have made multiple projects utilizing Ruby on Rails and have made a self-designed Python SQL query interface.

I first began coding ten years ago, mainly utilizing C++ up until 2019. At which point I then began learning web development and branched out to other languages such as Ruby, Javascript, Python, and more.

Favorite Programming Language: Ruby
